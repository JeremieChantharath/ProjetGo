In our ProjetGo project, the 9×9 board still suffers from misalignments between the grid, the stones and the coordinate labels. We have a utility file (utils/boardLayout.ts) that defines constants (BOARD_PADDING, GRID_MARGIN_PERCENT) and functions (calculateIntersectionSpacing(size) and calculateIntersectionPosition(pos, size)) for margins and spacing. Use these everywhere so that all positions and sizes are consistent.

Tasks to perform:

Use the same calculations for every position and size: call calculateIntersectionPosition() to compute the top and left of each intersection and each label, and call calculateIntersectionSpacing() to compute the width/height of a cell. Avoid hard‑coding 20 px or 24 px.

Update Intersection.tsx:

Pass size as a prop if needed.

Compute top and left in percentage with calculateIntersectionPosition(row, size) and calculateIntersectionPosition(col, size).

Compute the cell size with const tileSize = calculateIntersectionSpacing(size); and set width: \${tileSize}%`andheight: `${tileSize}%`.

Center each intersection by setting negative margins in percentages: marginLeft: \-${tileSize / 2}%`, marginTop: `-${tileSize / 2}%`. Important: these margins must be strings with percentage values, not pixel numbers.

Update BoardLabels.tsx:

For column letters (A, B, … J), position each Text with left: \${calculateIntersectionPosition(index, size)}%` and center it horizontally with a negative translate equal to half the cell width (translateX: -${calculateIntersectionSpacing(size)/2}%`).

For row numbers (1–9), position each Text with top: \${calculateIntersectionPosition(index, size)}%`` and center it vertically in the same way.

Remove the fixed offsets (top: -20, left: -20) and calculate the shift dynamically from the cell size.

Adjust Board.tsx: replace the fixed padding: 24 with a value based on BOARD_PADDING or a percentage so that there is room for the labels without overlapping the grid. Make sure showDebug stays off by default.

Eliminate magic numbers: remove static offsets like −20 or 24 so that all positions and sizes are derived from the functions in boardLayout.ts.

Once these changes are in place, test the board on different screen sizes to ensure the intersections, grid and coordinate labels finally align perfectly.
